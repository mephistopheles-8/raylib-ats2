# raylib-ats2

Raw bindings to [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) for ATS2.

These bindings do not utilize any special features of ATS2.
Resource leaks are still possible. 

Still planned:
- Function signatures need to reflect the constants they use.
- cPtr types should be updated to something more appropriate
- Resource and context tracking with views and viewtypes
