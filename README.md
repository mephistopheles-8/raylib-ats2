# raylib-ats2

Raw bindings to [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) for ATS2.

These bindings attempt to track resources and effects.
Resource and effect modelling may not be perfect yet.

I need to verify that this approach is ergonomic and useful.

Some parts of the library I haven't gotten to yet.  If you
see `cptr` types, it's likely that I haven't gotten around
to verifying the semantics of the given ptr.
