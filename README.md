# raylib-ats2

Raw bindings to [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) for ATS2.

These bindings attempt to track resources ATS2.
There may be some issues with resource / effect modelling

There is some preliminary modelling of effects;
I need to see how ergonomic this actually is.

Still planned:
- Function signatures need to reflect the constants they use.
- cPtr types should be updated to something more appropriate
- Resource and context tracking with views and viewtypes
